       <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
       
       <p>This department is concerned taught the basics of science and computing hardware, and requires the study of mathematics and logical design computer. Section is also interested in teaching different types of software; whether the system software, application software, as well as computer networks and artificial intelligence. This is in addition to selected topics intended to give a quick opportunity for faculty department to keep up with modern scientific development to teach what is new in computer science without waiting for modifying the regulation.
          The Department is keen to conduct innovative research in the areas mentioned above, whether it be by faculty members or research through graduate studies in Computer Science.
